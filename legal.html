                <h2 id="section2">2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>To facilitate account creation and authentication and otherwise manage user accounts.</strong> We may process your information so you can create and log in to your account, as well as keep your account in working order.</li>
                    <li><strong>To deliver and facilitate delivery of services to the user.</strong> We may process your information to provide you with the requested service.</li>
                    <li><strong>To enable user-to-user communications.</strong> We may process your information if you choose to use any of our offerings that allow for communication with another user.</li>

                <h2 id="section3">3. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
                
                <p><em>In Short: We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following third parties.</em></p>
                
                <p><strong>RoomThere does not sell or share your personal information with third parties for marketing or advertising purposes.</strong> We may need to share your personal information in the following limited situations:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Business Transfers.</strong> We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.</li>
                    <li><strong>When we use Google Maps Platform APIs.</strong> We may share your information with certain Google Maps Platform APIs (e.g., Google Maps API, Places API). Google Maps uses GPS, Wi-Fi, and cell towers to estimate your location. GPS is accurate to about 20 meters, while Wi-Fi and cell towers help improve accuracy when GPS signals are weak, like indoors. This data helps Google Maps provide directions, but it is not always perfectly precise.</li>
                    <li><strong>Background Check Processing.</strong> When you voluntarily choose to complete a background check through our third-party provider, we share only the information necessary to process that specific request.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="section4">4. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</h2>
                
                <p><em>In Short: We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.</em></p>
                
                <p>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to gather information when you interact with our Services. Some online tracking technologies help us maintain the security of our Services and your account, prevent crashes, fix bugs, save your preferences, and assist with basic site functions.</p>
                
                <p>We also permit third parties and service providers to use online tracking technologies on our Services for analytics and advertising, including to help manage and display advertisements, to tailor advertisements to your interests, or to send abandoned shopping cart reminders (depending on your communication preferences). The third parties and service providers use their technology to provide advertising about products and services tailored to your interests which may appear either on our Services or on other websites.</p>
                
                <p>To the extent these online tracking technologies are deemed to be a "sale"/"sharing" (which includes targeted advertising, as defined under the applicable laws) under applicable US state laws, you can opt out of these online tracking technologies by submitting a request as described below under section "DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?"</p>
                
                <p>Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice.</p>

                <h2 id="section5">5. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</h2>
                
                <p><em>In Short: If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a social media account, we may have access to certain information about you.</em></p>
                
                <p>Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or X logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.</p>
                
                <p>We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this Privacy Notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.</p>

                <h2 id="section6">6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
                
                <p><em>In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.</em></p>
                
                <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than three (3) months past the start of the idle period of the user's account.</p>
                
                <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

                <h2 id="section7">7. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>
                
                <p><em>In Short: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</em></p>
                
                <p>We do not knowingly collect, solicit data from, or market to children under 18 years of age, nor do we knowingly sell such personal information. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent's use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records.

                <h2 id="section9">9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
                
                <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.</p>
                
                <p>California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.</p>
